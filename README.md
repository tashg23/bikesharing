# bikesharing

## project_overview: 
To look into potentially starting a bike sharing company in Des Moines, Iowa. To do this, we will first examine bike sharing data from Citibike in NYC. 

Data source: https://citibikenyc.com/system-data

We will look specifically at August 2019 data since in August, there will likely be more traffic at this time of year. 

## results:

There were 2.3 M trips in August of 2019 in NYC.

The average trip duration was approximately 5 minutes a trip. Filtering by gender, another trend emerges:

Males tend to ride more frequently than females. Interestingly, trip duration seems similar between genders.

In the above heatmap, we see that subscribers ride more frequently than customers, unsurprisingly. Again, we see that males ride more frequently than females. It seems that Monday, Tuesday and Thursday are high frequency trip days.

Drilling down to time of day, trips are most frequently taken during the hours of 5 - 7 pm.

Again, we see a similar trend when filtering the same data by gender.

Lastly, we've mapped the starting location of all trips. The darker and larger circles indicate the highest frequency of starting locations, indicating perhaps more bikes could be allocated to these significant areas. 

## summary: 
Overall, we are able to determine basic trends that can be used to inform potential investors of the trends we would expect to see in our own bike sharing company. 

This analysis should be repeated for all months of the year, so we can determine if our new company in Des Moines is following an acceptable (profitable) trend. 

As well, it would be interesting to determine what is significant about the high frequency starting locations of the Citibike trips. Are they close to hotels, apartments, etc? Cross referencing this information would enable us to determine where we should situate our bike stations in Des Moines.
